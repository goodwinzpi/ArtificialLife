# Organism Types

## Network(input - action)
Organisms are defined in both their sensory input and the actions they can take by a Neural network. Mutations within hte network alter the manner
in which they respond to stimuli by changing the wight of links between input and action nodes, removing or adding links, and adding nodes between the input and 
action layers.

## Network(symbolic)
Organisms are defined by a network which does not directly impact the actions of the organism but is relevant to the organism's fitness within its environment. The 
network is the part of the organism mutated by the GA in order to solve the problem.

## Chromosome(symbolic)
Organisms are defined by a string of "chromosomes" selected from an alphanumeric alphabet of arbitrary length.
